# Flapping_wing_Simu


This is a flapping wing simulation code.

It is runned on webots.

It includes translational lift, translation drag, rotational lift and added mass 4 kinds of aerodynamic forces.

It is robotic application oriented.

And this branch is for trajectory tracking.

Blade element is coded into file such like SimpleFlapper0Tail_H20BLE_X_pos.npy, 
which can be generated by https://github.com/Chainplain/BladeEleBuilder
