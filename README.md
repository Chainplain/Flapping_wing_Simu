# Flapping_wing_Simu


This is a flapping wing simulation code.

It is runned on webots.

It includes translational lift, translation drag, rotational lift and added mass 4 kinds of aerodynamic forces.

It is robotic application oriented.

And this branch is for trajectory tracking.

Blade element is coded into file such like SimpleFlapper0Tail_H20BLE_X_pos.npy, 
which can be generated by https://github.com/Chainplain/BladeEleBuilder

## Installing 
You can use following steps to test your own algorithm:

    1. Download webots https://cyberbotics.com/, the version we use is R2021a. However, we are pretty sure that you can run it on any version after that.

    2. load the worldfile, which is already marked.

    3. choose the controller of the robot called the Flapper as SimpleFlapGamma_SensorFusion, which is also provided here. This is the controller file, you can rewrite the corresponding classes which are given in other files.

    4. If everything is fine, using https://github.com/Chainplain/FlappingwingSimu/blob/version2.0/SimpleFlapFirstMaster_Test_Position_Trajecory_Tracking%20.wbt it can be runned right away.
